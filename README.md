Linux System Programming 
NOTE: 
  Most of the code in this repo are examples that were transliterated by me from Michael Kerrisk's AMAZING book: The Linux Programming Interface.
  So although it was written by me, all copyright (except from the R-B Tree of threads I guess?) Belongs to him. 
  It is here because it is a resource I use when programming systems in my career.
